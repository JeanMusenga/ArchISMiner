# Replication for the Paper: *ArchISMiner: Automatic Mining of Architectural Issue–Solution Pairs from Online Developer Communities*

This replication package accompanies the paper ArchISMiner: Automatic Mining of Architectural Issue–Solution Pairs from Online Developer Communities.
It includes an introduction and research methodology overview, a description of the ArchISMiner framework, source code for its components and baselines, the dataset used in our study, and the experimental results.

## 🚨 Introduction and Research Methodology Overview

Stack Overflow (SO), a leading online community forum, is a rich source of software development knowledge. 
However, locating architectural knowledge (e.g., architectural solutions) remains challenging due to the overwhelming volume of unstructured content and fragmented discussions.
Developers must manually sift through posts to find relevant architectural insights, which is both time-consuming and error-prone. To address this, we introduce **ArchISMiner**, a framework for automatically mining architectural knowledge from SO. 
The research methodology employed is illustrated below:

## 🏗️ ArchISMiner Framework

**ArchISMiner** is a framework for automatically mining architectural knowledge from Stack Overflow (SO) posts. It comprises two complementary components:

- **ArchPI** – Identifies Architecture-Related Posts (ARPs) from the broader set of SO posts. Specifically, it leverages a diverse set of models, including traditional machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), state-of-the-art pre-trained language models (PLMs), and large language models (LLMs), to select the optimal model for this task.

- **ArchISPE** – Extracts architectural issue–solution pairs from the identified ARPs to capture task-specific architectural knowledge. Given an ARP (i.e., a Question_body and its corresponding Answer_body) consisting of 𝑛 sentences, ArchISPE extracts a small set of key sentences that explicitly express architectural issues and solutions, and generates a concise, self-contained issue-solution pair for the post.

Together, these components enable software engineers, particularly architects and developers, to efficiently gather relevant and useful architectural knowledge from online developer communities.

## 🛠️ Dataset Description

The `data/` directory includes:
- `14932_ARPs_and_Programming_Posts.xlsx` – contains posts labeled as APRs and programming posts (i.e., 7,466 ARPs and 7,466 Programming Posts) used to train and test the classifiers. 
- `366_ARPs_for_extracting_Issue_Solution_Pairs.xlsx` – contains randomly selected 366 ARPs from 7,466 ARPs for extracting architectural issue-solution pairs.
- `ArchIssueSolutionBench.xlsx` – contains our proposed architectural benchmark used to evaluate the potential techniques for extracting architectural issue-solution pairs from online developer community forums.
